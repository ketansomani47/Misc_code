"I love how diverse the functionality of Dealertrack, from tracking employee activity to streamlining processes this is a tremendously helpful tool",1
"Dealertrack has ""married"" with so many other systems, we have long term employees with multi-profiles as a result.  It would be great if there was an automated process to merge the systems to create a better user experience as the platform expands.",0
It makes it easier to receive the credit applications from clients digitally verses over the phone. ,1
"The credit application form allows clients to leave out important information that's needed for a credit decision from a bank which means we have to call and get the information. At that point we might as well just get the whole thing over the phone. Also, the number of users allowed access to the program causes problems for being able to pull the info late at night when the people are gone for the day. ",0
"I used dealertrack as a receptionist for a car dealership for about a year.  Once you know where everything is and what numbers and info to put where, it's a really easy program to use for a dealership needs. I was able to get fast and get salesmen and managers reports they needed very quickly! ",1
This program looks very dated. It's also almost impossible to find things on your own. I went through a couple days of training to learn how to navigate the software and for the next few weeks I had to reference cheat sheets I had made or ask questions. ,0
"After the initial learning curve, things are pretty straight forward. The thing I like most is being able to streamline processes in our company that used to take up infinitely more time than they do now. ",1
Some features that can be approved on is menu placement for shortcuts when working within workflows. Also being able to edit tickets that have been booked and make amends if need be. ,0
"It is point and click, very easy to use. Everyone can be proficient from day one",1
Has an occasional gremlin where a trade in will show up sold to the customer who murchased,0
"ease of use,  information available anytime at my fingertips,.  Loved the ability to communicate with lenders directly from site. ability to save and store deals.  all compliance material available at your fingertips.  ",1
"a little difficult to move from one deal to another without saving information first, but overall I am well satisfied with product ",0
"Their customer support for troubleshooting with printers can be great.  When you get a truly qualified support specialist, they really take the time to make sure your issue is resolved. ",1
Unfortunately when their customer support is lacking knowledge or wiliness to take the time to listen it can put a sour taste in your mouth.,0
"I like using dealertrack.  As a F&I manager at an automotive dealership, I use Dealertrack to submit all of my credit applications and it is so easy to use!  I can access payoffs, approvals, and everything in between with Dealertrack.",1
"Every so often, the software goes down and it can take minutes or hours for it to come back.  I also wish there was a way to transfer my credit apps into my Lot Wizard instead of having to re-type everything.",0
"The shortcut key options to create a deal or add a new line to a work order were the best for saving time, especially when creating multiple sales for the same fleet customer, or multiple PDI work orders.",1
The accounting integration could have been improved to incorporate accessory sales and gross profits. We would have to add accessories and manually calculate the gross profit on the sale and installation. ,0
"Their customer service is not the best but it is above average.
My company integrates with DealerTrack and their support staff is superb. 
Their website is very organized and the interface makes it easy to navigate. ",1
The only con I have ran into is that their website on works on Internet Explorer and can not be accessed through Google Chrome without an extension. ,0
"I like the software, very easy to use, easy to set up and also easy to train my employees on how to use the software.",1
"The one con I would say Dealertrack has, which it hasn't happened for awhile now, is that the website will go down and we can't use the software until the website comes back online.",0
Uptodate tech. Great source of options. Dealertrack as a company is very productive in their operations.,1
Regarding the child company Dealer.com: Customer support has many breaks in communication between support reps and techs. The background coding environment used antiquated code. It takes way to long to resolve minor issues. Promises are often made yet are not fulfilled.,0
"Inputting info easy to do, communication with lenders is good.                                               ",1
"Going in between multiple applications with one customer, navigation is redundant
finding forms and lenders is not user friendly",0
"Widely used in Auto industry, same parent company as various other softwares important in the automotive sector.",1
"Very antiquated interface and apparently no intention to upgrade. Printer set up is like the davinci code.  Customer support is terrible.  Not designed for an independent dealer, only OEM's.",0
I like that I have become accustomed to all of the features and its ease of use. Being a daily user I need something that functions properly so I can work efficiently.,1
Sometimes the software can crash with some regularity.,0
I use this daily in my work and it helps me with internet sales. Can track customers and work my leads easily.,1
Can be veryyy slow at times. Won't allow me to log on. The function commands are confusing at times. ,0
What I like most is you can submit credit applications for potential car buys and do all the financing paper work all on the same software.,1
What I like least about the software is sometimes it does crash and you have to call technical support. ,0
Easy to use for our business office managers and our office staff. Great program that helps track incentives. ,1
Cost is a little higher than others but we dont mind paying a little extra to get such a great and easy to use product,0
Super easy to use especially for uploaded deals and stips ,1
"Not very mobile friendly, very hard to log in with a mobile device",0
Love that all my banks can receive the application with a click ,1
I love everything about it almost never have any problems ,0
THE EASE OF SUBMITING APPLICATIONS TO MY DIFFERENT LENDERS.,1
I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SOFTWARE.,0
It makes doing business with my lenders so easy and saves a lot of time.,1
"Nothing it works great, for what we need.",0
"ease of use and custoemr service. drop down menus are great to work with, search tools are also great.",1
The system can be a little glitchy and often times will close out without saving your work. When copying an app over it doesn't carry all of the info over either,0
The program is not overly complicated and easy to use overall,1
Sometimes the features are a little basic.,0
"Reasonable rate, Great DMS, better than any I have used",1
