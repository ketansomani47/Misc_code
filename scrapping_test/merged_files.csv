DEALERTRACK IS VERY USER FRIENDLY AND I LIKE ALL THE REFERENCE MATERIAL AVAILABLE.,1.0
I DO NOT LIKE THE FACT THAT IS SOME REPORTING YOU CAN'T REFERENCE TWO YEARS TOGETHER.  YOU HAVE TO PRINT EACH YEAR SEPARATELY.,0.0
I enjoyed being able to long on anywhere to underwrite deals.  It also made pulling reports and entering new dealers easy.  ,1.0
"I did not like when I could not get a dealer to “line up”. Most of the time they lined up perfect, but sometimes it would take too long.  ",0.0
"When it is up and running it is useful and would be great, the idea of what it can do is exactly what you would want.   If I want to see the service history from the last year I couldn't get all the information I needed.  Not sure if this is because we didn't have the software integrated correctly or what.  ",1.0
"Had problems logging on in the morning when I first got to work.  The Vin scanner doesn't always read on the first try, have to scan and scan to get it to read.    The mobile application just didn't work fast enough.  I often had to go back to my desk to get all the data I needed and by then it was too late to capitalized on the initial  interaction with the customer.  ",0.0
They consistently stay up to date and on top of their platform.,1.0
Does not show ltv and other things while submitting  like some competitors.,0.0

Dealer track has a tool for almost every need in the industry. Very easy to use. Always Improving and adding valuable tools.,1.0
Cost should be tailored to dealership size and use of product. Not to take away from its value because there is no better tool for the automobile industry.,0.0
Allowes me to view multiple finance companies at a press of a button.  Gives you information on additional documents that are needed.  Quick information upload ,1.0
The cons for me is that it allowed other F&I users to see qualified and minimal qualified candidates.  This did create issues with cherry picking.,0.0
Entering inventory is easy. Connecting to our site is easy. ,1.0
"Design and layout of some features is not easy, visually appealing. ",0.0
Easy to use.  Has more current features after converting from Reynolds and Reynolds.  Way cheaper as well.,1.0
Seems to be lacking some features that are present in other areas of the software.  Suggestions need to have at least 50 votes before Dealertrack will even look at it.,0.0
It allows me to accomplish most of my daily tasks without much headache,1.0
The user interface isn't great. It could be so much better. Some parameters should be automatic. In the forms section the scroll function is weird and everything seems very old school.,0.0
"I love to be able to access the different financial institutes for payoffs, you cant image how much time this saves.",1.0
I would love it if more banks signed up with them. It gives you easy access without ever having to pick up the telephone and hold on for 20 minutes.,0.0
Dealertrack DMS was easy to use and integrated well with the web provider that we used at the time. ,1.0
The accounting side seemed very antiquated and was not easy to pull monthly reports,0.0
It's easy to use and keeps track of inventory and leads in a comprehensive manner.  You can make as many quotes as you need.,1.0
I wish the font and colors were darker because we have a hard time seeing the screen sometimes.  Great product though.,0.0
The product caters around the auto industry in all ways.  It's consistently getting better by the day. ,1.0
Certain software glitches with all the new additions they have been making. The problem is dealing with the IT support in India.  ,0.0
It's integration with the best software and your key to all available lenders. They already have generated standardized forms so there are no times you'll need to reinvent the wheel,1.0
"Price, but you can only have two or is the criteria. If it's good and fast, it's not cheap. If it's fast and cheap, it's not good. And if it's cheap and good, it's not fast. Pick two. ",0.0
Easy of use. Organized. Easy to visually look at inventory. Feeds data to various websites with minimal hiccups and reliable.,1.0
User interface is somewhat outdated and needs a fresh look. Easier ways to search for inventory.,0.0
"Cheap alternative to the big dogs (ADP, REYNOLDS, ect)",1.0
System is always going down and running slow. Ridiculous to run a business this way.,0.0

I do not have any cons for Dealertrack.  The honestly are the best around,0.0
#NAME?,1.0
-Has a bit of a learning curve -The website should have a walkthrough for new users to learn the platform Nothing other than those 2 i've noticed,0.0
The software offers a true variety of options when it comes to daily operations. The team at Dealertrack is always on top of updates and communication and the system rarely if ever has any issues.,1.0
"There aren't many cons from my standpoint, it provides a tool to help get things done in an efficient manner. The only issue you may run into is when you have people setting up others accounts, they can either give too much or too little to the user in terms of options. I would advise training the HR or whomever you will have set the program up to be very specific to each persons roll in the company, again this is a user issue not the program itself",0.0
It makes it easier to receive the credit applications from clients digitally verses over the phone. ,1.0
"The credit application form allows clients to leave out important information that’s needed for a credit decision from a bank which means we have to call and get the information. At that point we might as well just get the whole thing over the phone. Also, the number of users allowed access to the program causes problems for being able to pull the info late at night when the people are gone for the day. ",0.0
"After the initial learning curve, things are pretty straight forward. The thing I like most is being able to streamline processes in our company that used to take up infinitely more time than they do now. ",1.0
Some features that can be approved on is menu placement for shortcuts when working within workflows. Also being able to edit tickets that have been booked and make amends if need be. ,0.0
"I love how diverse the functionality of Dealertrack, from tracking employee activity to streamlining processes this is a tremendously helpful tool",1.0
"Dealertrack has ""married"" with so many other systems, we have long term employees with multi-profiles as a result.  It would be great if there was an automated process to merge the systems to create a better user experience as the platform expands.",0.0
"It is point and click, very easy to use. Everyone can be proficient from day one",1.0
Has an occasional gremlin where a trade in will show up sold to the customer who murchased,0.0
"Before Dealertrack, trying to get credit applications over to banks was a tedious and monotonous process in which created a lot of tension for customers. The reason? Because to wait for a disposition for a customer could take quite some time. Enter Dealertrack! With Dealertrack, getting approvals was quick and easy. ",1.0
"Nothing to report. During the time that I used it, I don't ever recall having any issues or having to call them up for either training or technical support. This is a true testament to how easy their software is to use. ",0.0
"Very diverse DMS for the money. Switched from one of the other big three to Dealertrack and after we got our feet wet, you couldn’t make anyone go back. ",1.0
"Need to ensure you take this rare time to start fresh and clean up your accounting and processes. No sense in bringing the old ways to the new set up (and typically you don’t switch a DMS often). We, unfortunately, did not do our due diligence and the implementation folks are going to do what you ask- which was foolish on our part. Because of that we had a few months after where it was not as smooth as I would have liked",0.0
"Absolutely NOTHING, the ONLY thing this update did was get me to look into RouteOne!",1.0
"There is absolutely nothing i like about it, WHY would you change something that wasn't broken and user friendly? I don't get it, so i will be looking into other options!",0.0
"ease of use,  information available anytime at my fingertips,.  Loved the ability to communicate with lenders directly from site. ability to save and store deals.  all compliance material available at your fingertips.  ",1.0
"a little difficult to move from one deal to another without saving information first, but overall I am well satisfied with product ",0.0
"It is very easy to train employees to use and is esthetically appealing. Also, its integration with other products, specifically its DMS, is second to none. ",1.0
It is limited. You have to pay for everything. It has limited internal capabilities. Very expensive. No captive has partnered with them to mitigate said costs. ,0.0
"I like using dealertrack.  As a F&I manager at an automotive dealership, I use Dealertrack to submit all of my credit applications and it is so easy to use!  I can access payoffs, approvals, and everything in between with Dealertrack.",1.0
"Every so often, the software goes down and it can take minutes or hours for it to come back.  I also wish there was a way to transfer my credit apps into my Lot Wizard instead of having to re-type everything.",0.0
"The shortcut key options to create a deal or add a new line to a work order were the best for saving time, especially when creating multiple sales for the same fleet customer, or multiple PDI work orders.",1.0
The accounting integration could have been improved to incorporate accessory sales and gross profits. We would have to add accessories and manually calculate the gross profit on the sale and installation. ,0.0
"Their customer support for troubleshooting with printers can be great.  When you get a truly qualified support specialist, they really take the time to make sure your issue is resolved. ",1.0
Unfortunately when their customer support is lacking knowledge or wiliness to take the time to listen it can put a sour taste in your mouth.,0.0
"I like the software, very easy to use, easy to set up and also easy to train my employees on how to use the software.",1.0
"The one con I would say Dealertrack has, which it hasn't happened for awhile now, is that the website will go down and we can't use the software until the website comes back online.",0.0
I love that Dealertrack integrates with my other DMS software and I can seamlessly send apps to all of my chosen lenders. Counter offers are made right there and all within minutes. It shortens the car buying process for customers and F&I. ,1.0
There is a little bit of a learning curve when you first start. But the staff is very helpful and will help you get the most out of the system. ,0.0
"I like the ease of the General Ledger side of Dealertrack. For me, it works pretty well and is easy to navigate.",1.0
I wish the stocking in of parts would translate into processing an invoice easier.,0.0
Uptodate tech. Great source of options. Dealertrack as a company is very productive in their operations.,1.0
Regarding the child company Dealer.com: Customer support has many breaks in communication between support reps and techs. The background coding environment used antiquated code. It takes way to long to resolve minor issues. Promises are often made yet are not fulfilled.,0.0
"I used dealertrack as a receptionist for a car dealership for about a year.  Once you know where everything is and what numbers and info to put where, it's a really easy program to use for a dealership needs. I was able to get fast and get salesmen and managers reports they needed very quickly! ",1.0
This program looks very dated. It's also almost impossible to find things on your own. I went through a couple days of training to learn how to navigate the software and for the next few weeks I had to reference cheat sheets I had made or ask questions. ,0.0
" This product is very easy to use, which ultimately makes my job easier. Their customer service is very helpful as well",1.0

"Widely used in Auto industry, same parent company as various other softwares important in the automotive sector.",1.0
"Very antiquated interface and apparently no intention to upgrade. Printer set up is like the davinci code.  Customer support is terrible.  Not designed for an independent dealer, only OEM's.",0.0
I love how easy Dealertrack DMS is for our used car lot. We use it daily to track our inventory and submit finance deals through outside lenders. The documents provided are very helpful for our business as well. Its very easy to learn!,1.0

"I wasnt too find of the Payroll with Dealertrack, however, couldnt be more happy with the switch to Netchex.",0.0
Using this DMS software daily has been a little bit of a steep learning curve after so many years with Reynolds & Reynolds but as the time goes on it becomes more and more intuitive on a day to day basis. It seems they continue to run updates and improve the experience as well. ,1.0
"Would have liked some more in depth training related to those that are computer savvy, there are a number of shortcuts that come in hand that we've had to learn ourselves that make using this DMS worlds more simple. Maybe consider adding this into the training program going forward.",0.0
What I like most is you can submit credit applications for potential car buys and do all the financing paper work all on the same software.,1.0
What I like least about the software is sometimes it does crash and you have to call technical support. ,0.0

Cost is a little higher than others but we dont mind paying a little extra to get such a great and easy to use product,0.0
Their customer service is not the best but it is above average. My company integrates with DealerTrack and their support staff is superb.  Their website is very organized and the interface makes it easy to navigate. ,1.0
The only con I have ran into is that their website on works on Internet Explorer and can not be accessed through Google Chrome without an extension. ,0.0
"Great for utilizing your customers information for a deal structure, pulling credit and expediting your deal to all the Banks and Credit Unions you use for approvals.",1.0
"Unfortunately, not all Banks or Credit Unions use the Dealer Track platform.  And you have to be established with a Bank or Credit Union to expedite a deal to.  It would be nice if the system had Financial Institutes on their platform to help out Independent Dealers.",0.0

"At our dealership, the parts department and service department really like the software. Creating repair orders and parts tickets are pretty easy and straightforward. Customer support is also good when you need assistance. The vehicle sales side of things takes many more steps than it should, but it certainly gets the job done in the long run.",1.0
"As this is a cloud-based solution, there are occasional outages with the data center. When this happens, our entire business is impacted since it runs every aspect of it. ",0.0

Also keeps a record of  each customer, loan information and lender information all in one place. ",1.0
There isn't much that I don't like about the software. I know it does a lot more than I even use it for. If I have to give a con the only thing I can think of is that the password needs to be changed often and when using multiple programs and software it gets annoying to change all the passwords so frequently but that's just a small thing that takes an extra 30 seconds.,0.0

DealerTrack DMS software does a very good job pulling in VIN specific vehicle data allowing for our inventory to stay accurate and up to date.,1.0

I've been using DealerTrack for about 2 years now and overall it has been a pretty good experience. Not many issues using it or down time with the software. Was a little difficult getting used to the layouts and different ways to do basically the same thing but once you are used to it there is little issue.,
We have been on DealerTrack for about 2 months now.  The system is easy to navigate and use but the appointment setting needs to be updated!  Better value $$ against other DMS systems!,
Dealertrack is a must have software for any dealership.  Makes F&I easy and integrates all of our aftermarket sales products.  eMenu is a great additional tool that makes upselling effortless.,
"We use this to build deals for new and used car sales. There's a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, you can figure and refigure deals pretty quickly. Especially great for leases.",
"One of the better DMS systems out there but pricey for Independents, more for your money with Dealercenter.",

Not a good one too much money for nothing of value in return. Customer service sucks and training is horrible you may as well do your own thing you will get more out of it!,
I worked with a car dealership and though this was helpful it was different from what I was accustomed to.  I think it is fairly standard software though.,1.0
I did not like that there were not standard email templates to contact clients.  This would have made things faster and easier.,0.0
