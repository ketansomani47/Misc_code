"Prior to having Dealertrack BookOut, I would have to go to another site entirely to get the vehicle value. Now, with one click I have an accurate retail, loan and trade value - it's a real timesaver.",
"We're able to complete deals faster because with one click, the bank can see the contract. No mailing of contracts means no more waiting.",
"Dealertrack's DMS has put us in a position to handle things both in the present and prepare for the future, whether it's improving our processes now or acquiring more dealerships in the future.",
"I can't say enough about eMenu for iPad. It makes my job easier, and customers love the feeling of control when the iPad is in their hands. I can change packages on the fly or pull them apart to get exactly what the customer wants. It's easy to do and unlike a paper menu, it always looks professional.",
The great thing about Dealertrack eMenu for iPad® is that I can use it anywhere.,
"Effective technology does two things really well. First, it improves operational efficiency. And in doing that, it empowers us to create an optimal car-buying experience.",
"Thanks to Dealertrack, we go into deals with confidence that every salesperson will cover the required aspects for compliance with federal regulations. By integrating it into our workflow, we make sure that we're doing what we need to do – when we need to do it.",
Dealertrack technology and integration far outweighs others that I've seen or used in the past.,
We were promised by Dealertrack that it would be a smooth transition. The whole process was much smoother than I thought it would be.,
"I trust Dealertrack because anytime I've had something that didn't go the way I thought it was going to go, I have a person that I reach out to, not a phone bank.",
Dealertrack is never stagnant. They keep moving forward so that we can have the best system to help us compete in today's market.,
"We pay less money for a system that works better than anything that we've seen from other DMS providers. We don't have a lot of headaches and when we have a problem, we get a lot better service from Dealertrack than we ever did from our previous provider.",
Dealertrack gives us those additional weapons to go out there and meet market demands and serve our customers.,
"When we use eMenu for iPad®, we see a higher level of process efficiency and better customer engagement. It's the best tool out there to deliver the transparency today's customers demand.",
Dealertrack has always been and will continue to be on the cutting edge of technology.,
"If you're not with Dealertrack, it's only because you haven't tried it. The system and the people are phenomenal, and they actually do what they say they are going to do. You can't get that anywhere else.",
"If we don't invest in technology, the market passes us by. It's critical that our staff has the tools that they need to help answer client questions. That's where the technology comes in. Dealertrack provides us a very easy to use, simple solution.",
"We work together with Dealertrack in a way that we never did with our previous provider. There's much more interaction and partnership, and we know they are truly invested in helping us use the system to extract the most value. It's made our entire group more successful.",
I want my staff focused on taking care of the customers. I don't want them struggling with the DMS. The Dealertrack DMS is intuitive to use. It's simple and allows my staff to focus on their jobs.,
"Dealertrack keeps us flexible, quick, and accurate, so we can adapt to change, overcome obstacles, and persevere through any economic or business condition.",
"Going digital has significantly decreased funding time, resulting in faster cash flow and reduced customer wait times.",
"We still have people coming by and checking on us, spending not just a couple hours, but spending days in the dealership to make sure that we are understanding and utilizing the entire system.",
"There is always a fear of change when switching to a new DMS provider. Switching from one DMS provider to another DMS provider can be very challenging, unless you're switching to Dealertrack.",
"We used to have to custom report or handcreate reports. And now we can just click download and five minutes later we're onto the next task. If I had to guess, we won back three to four labor days in a month.",
"As we've grown, they've grown with us. We don't consider Dealertrack DMS as a vendor. We consider Dealertrack DMS as a partner.",
I get a comfort level using the compliance product from Dealertrack. I know I'm being protected.,
"If you're hiring someone, it can be done through their home computer, where they can pretty much do all their onboarding paperwork from their computer at home. The day they start they're pretty much already done. Their first day is spent in their home department and not filling out paperwork in HR.",
"Dealertrack lets us be flexible with the way we want to do business, and it's so easy to use.",
"The one-stop-shopping factor is what is most beneficial for me. I have a lot of years handling title work for numerous states and though I could accomplish it all manually, having CMS at hand to keep all the different states and types of titles organized is well worth the cost.",
"We've got a lot of Cox [Automotive] products already. When you keep in the Cox family and you merge with third-party integrations, it is so much more streamlined and easier. I would tell people out there looking to make DMS changes, the best advice I can give is it's not always about the money. It's listening to your team.",
"The Dealertrack system is really powerful, but still easy to use, and it definitely gives us a better process which is always going to help with retention and customer satisfaction.",
Dealertrack really seems to understand what's important to our business and is on top of finding ways to make our lives easier. The flexibility of the Dealertrack DMS lets us do business our way and continue to drive success in our 50th anniversary year and beyond.,
"If someone was looking to make a switch, I would tell them look at more than just the switching anxiety, because you can work through that. You can have a great partnership with Dealertrack to help get you where you need to go. It is hard, but I don't think it's as scary as it may seem like it could be.",
"With Dealertrack, I've got all the information I need accessible on a mobile device, on an iPad; anywhere that I go, I can see what's happening with all our stores.",
"The switch to Dealertrack enabled us to really organize the way we thought about (our) business. Switching over was kind of like cleaning out the garage, taking everything out, blowing out the cobwebs, and putting it back the way (we) wanted to put it back.",
"I can track closing percentage of every service consultant I have, all the way down to how many brakes they offered on ASRs, did we attach media, and what was the closing ratio if we did.",
"We didn't need more people to grow, we just needed a better DMS company to help us. Dealertrack comes to us with ideas, they're progressive in their thinking, and they really care. We wouldn't switch for anything.",
"The customer's perception of the speed of the process is changing. If customers are apprehensive and nervous and want out of your office as quickly as possible, it's probably because you didn't answer their questions. They want a better experience, not necessarily a faster experience. That's what we're giving them now, and our improved CSI scores prove we're on to something. If you're not using Dealertrack's eMenu for iPad, you should be. It is what the customer is demanding at this point.",
"Dealertrack DMS is a better system. It's more cost effective, it's easier to use, and our employees like it. To me, that's what a DMS is all about.",
Dealertrack's business model of innovation aligns with ours. Our attitude is to always improve and grow and Dealertrack's right there with us.,

"25 years and 23 locations later, I still choose Dealertrack DMS.",
Compliance requirements are always evolving and Dealertrack's compliance solution helps keep our dealership up-to-date.,
"I wish I would have switched to Dealertrack sooner for [the benefit of] the entire group. The DMS shouldn't be a burden, and in the past [our legacy system] bogged people down. I wanted our staff to have a system that's there to support them and make them efficient to where we can focus on our customer interactions.",
It's a 21st century way to go about purchasing a vehicle. The experience we've created and feedback we've received is tremendous.,
"Performance Management within Dealertrack is one of the most beneficial portions of the business model of Dealertrack, amongst just the software. To actually have somebody that can utilize the tool and help us utilize the tool to be most efficient is industry standard.",
We went from zero to booking up to $2M a month in auto loans.,
