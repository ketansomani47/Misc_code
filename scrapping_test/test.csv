"When it is up and running it is useful and would be great, the idea of what it can do is exactly what you would want.   If I want to see the service history from the last year I couldn't get all the information I needed.  Not sure if this is because we didn't have the software integrated correctly or what.  ","Had problems logging on in the morning when I first got to work.  The Vin scanner doesn't always read on the first try, have to scan and scan to get it to read.    The mobile application just didn't work fast enough.  I often had to go back to my desk to get all the data I needed and by then it was too late to capitalized on the initial  interaction with the customer.

The team at Dealertrack is always on top of updates and communication and the system rarely if ever has any issues.,"There aren't many cons from my standpoint, it provides a tool to help get things done in an efficient manner. The only issue you may run into is when you have people setting up others accounts, they can either give too much or too little to the user in terms of options.

It makes it easier to receive the credit applications from clients digitally verses over the phone. ,"The credit application form allows clients to leave out important information that’s needed for a credit decision from a bank which means we have to call and get the information.

"Very diverse DMS for the money. Switched from one of the other big three to Dealertrack and after we got our feet wet, you couldn’t make anyone go back. ","Need to ensure you take this rare time to start fresh and clean up your accounting and processes. No sense in bringing the old ways to the new set up (and typically you don’t switch a DMS often).
