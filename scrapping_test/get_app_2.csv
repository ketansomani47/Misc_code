No cons were added to this review,0
They consistently stay up to date and on top of their platform.,1
Does not show ltv and other things while submitting  like some competitors.,0
The software offers a true variety of options when it comes to daily operations. The team at Dealertrack is always on top of updates and communication and the system rarely if ever has any issues.,1
"There aren't many cons from my standpoint, it provides a tool to help get things done in an efficient manner. The only issue you may run into is when you have people setting up others accounts, they can either give too much or too little to the user in terms of options. I would advise training the HR or whomever you will have set the program up to be very specific to each persons roll in the company, again this is a user issue not the program itself",0
"Before Dealertrack, trying to get credit applications over to banks was a tedious and monotonous process in which created a lot of tension for customers. The reason? Because to wait for a disposition for a customer could take quite some time. Enter Dealertrack! With Dealertrack, getting approvals was quick and easy. ",1
"Nothing to report. During the time that I used it, I don't ever recall having any issues or having to call them up for either training or technical support. This is a true testament to how easy their software is to use. ",0
"Very diverse DMS for the money. Switched from one of the other big three to Dealertrack and after we got our feet wet, you couldn't make anyone go back. ",1
"Need to ensure you take this rare time to start fresh and clean up your accounting and processes. No sense in bringing the old ways to the new set up (and typically you don't switch a DMS often). We, unfortunately, did not do our due diligence and the implementation folks are going to do what you ask- which was foolish on our part. Because of that we had a few months after where it was not as smooth as I would have liked",0
"Absolutely NOTHING, the ONLY thing this update did was get me to look into RouteOne!",1
"There is absolutely nothing i like about it, WHY would you change something that wasn't broken and user friendly? I don't get it, so i will be looking into other options!",0
"When it is up and running it is useful and would be great, the idea of what it can do is exactly what you would want. 

If I want to see the service history from the last year I couldn't get all the information I needed.  Not sure if this is because we didn't have the software integrated correctly or what.  ",1
"Had problems logging on in the morning when I first got to work.  The Vin scanner doesn't always read on the first try, have to scan and scan to get it to read.  

The mobile application just didn't work fast enough.  I often had to go back to my desk to get all the data I needed and by then it was too late to capitalized on the initial  interaction with the customer.  ",0
"It is very easy to train employees to use and is esthetically appealing. Also, its integration with other products, specifically its DMS, is second to none. ",1
It is limited. You have to pay for everything. It has limited internal capabilities. Very expensive. No captive has partnered with them to mitigate said costs. ,0
It allows me to accomplish most of my daily tasks without much headache,1
The user interface isn't great. It could be so much better. Some parameters should be automatic. In the forms section the scroll function is weird and everything seems very old school.,0
"Overall Cost is the normal variable in choosing the DealerTrack DMS
*Cheaper Dealer solution than either CDK or Reynolds &Reynolds

Some Aspects of the DMS can be Automated even though the overall solution is FTP based.

Navigation is not too intensive

Able to set up Auto run extractions for provision to a CRM Solution

Setup of reporting and or File runs is normally easily accomplished

Offers In house Integration with Service App X-Time",1
"Reporting is not as extensive as offered by other DMS providers

X-Time integration can be spotty at times

Limitations on the amount of Historical data that is maintained within the DMS, remaining Data is archived and is not as easily accessible.

System is not Live update for Automated reporting
*Example: Automated reports set up today do not get recognized by the system as such until the nightly update occurs. 

Seems to be fewer people available at a dealership that possess the proper admin access required for setting up reports or reviewing High end information.",0
I love that Dealertrack integrates with my other DMS software and I can seamlessly send apps to all of my chosen lenders. Counter offers are made right there and all within minutes. It shortens the car buying process for customers and F&I. ,1
There is a little bit of a learning curve when you first start. But the staff is very helpful and will help you get the most out of the system. ,0
"Dealer track has a tool for almost every need in the industry.
Very easy to use.
Always Improving and adding valuable tools.",1
Cost should be tailored to dealership size and use of product. Not to take away from its value because there is no better tool for the automobile industry.,0
"I love to be able to access the different financial institutes for payoffs, you cant image how much time this saves.",1
I would love it if more banks signed up with them. It gives you easy access without ever having to pick up the telephone and hold on for 20 minutes.,0
"I like the ease of the General Ledger side of Dealertrack. For me, it works pretty well and is easy to navigate.",1
I wish the stocking in of parts would translate into processing an invoice easier.,0
Allowes me to view multiple finance companies at a press of a button.  Gives you information on additional documents that are needed.  Quick information upload ,1
The cons for me is that it allowed other F&I users to see qualified and minimal qualified candidates.  This did create issues with cherry picking.,0
" This product is very easy to use, which ultimately makes my job easier. Their customer service is very helpful as well",1
"There have been several times my leads have gotten ""stuck"" and i have had to call to get them taken care of. It doesn't happen often.",0
Dealertrack DMS was easy to use and integrated well with the web provider that we used at the time. ,1
The accounting side seemed very antiquated and was not easy to pull monthly reports,0
"The interface is very sleek and easy to use, I love it and hope the company never switches over to another software",1
"There isn't too much I don't like about this software, It's slow at times, But that could very well be out internet.",0
It's easy to use and keeps track of inventory and leads in a comprehensive manner.  You can make as many quotes as you need.,1
I wish the font and colors were darker because we have a hard time seeing the screen sometimes.  Great product though.,0
I love how easy Dealertrack DMS is for our used car lot. We use it daily to track our inventory and submit finance deals through outside lenders. The documents provided are very helpful for our business as well. Its very easy to learn!,1
Nothing that I do not like about Dealertrack DMS,0
The direct access it gives to multiple lenders. ,1
Sometimes the deals get stuck between me and another lender and I have to call to get it pushed through. ,0
The product caters around the auto industry in all ways.  It's consistently getting better by the day. ,1
Certain software glitches with all the new additions they have been making. The problem is dealing with the IT support in India.  ,0
"Dealertrack DMS is very easy to use, as well has great helpful customer service as well as superior hospitality. ",1
Don't think I can think of any issues with the software due to its simplex. ,0
