I can get my credit report and submit credit app all in same place!  Multiple options for lenders in one site!,1
It can get confusing if you're not trained how to input the taxes and extra fees.,0
I used Dealertrack at a Ford Dealership as Service Writer and found it easy to operate and navigate. ,1
"A glitch in the system prevented codes to be properly read.  Found out later that it needed a software update, which fixed the problem.",0
It links well with our banks and is easy to track deals from start to finish. ,1
No cons at this time.  It is easy to navigate and they are good at keeping you informed. ,0

Easy to use.,1
Not a lot of options,0
"The product is good depending on which banks you use. We used it a lot in the past, got away from it for many years, and slowly started using it again. Pretty simple to use customer service is pretty descent.",1
It's limited to which banks you can use.,0
DealerTrack DMS software does a very good job pulling in VIN specific vehicle data allowing for our inventory to stay accurate and up to date.,1
"DealerTrack DMS software does not always pull VIN specific vehicle data for current or upcoming model year vehicles, which does make things difficult at the beginning at the new year. ",0
"Financing can be complicated, but this makes the whole process very simple.",1
"No real negatives to speak of, very smooth experience.",0
Easy to build tickets for clients and to put parts on tickets. Very customizable,1
Too bulky a process for easy retail sales,0
Fairly easy DMS to navigate with a small amount of training (online video training) .  Ability for appointment scheduling and and technicians  are able to get a handle on system in a couple of days.  ,1
Trainers that came to our dealership were more helpful fixing and setting up for us instead of explaining whys and how tos. ,0
The program is so easy to use and navigate! If you can't remember codes it gives you a drop down to help! DMS support is super helpful ,1
There's nothing we dislike about dealertrack! It's a great program!                                 ,0
The modern design is easy to use. Great fiction and integration. Easy to learn. Web based is always the most desireable ,1
"Dealer track and it's suite are usually pretty expensive. The dms, marketing and credit software together are more than a lot of independent ",0
Nothing to like absolutely awful It is like playing ps5 and then switching to Atari ,1
Everything it has to offer can be done in other systems so much more efficiently ,0
"Easy to use and set up, able to connect with all of your finance companies in one software.",1
They should continue to grow and work with more banks.,0
